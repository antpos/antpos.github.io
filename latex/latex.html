			<h1>LaTeX notes</h1>
			<p>After I found the LaTeX and after few stumbles. 
			I found there is no return back to WYSIWYGs. 
			Not for me at least. 
			Below are my notes for LaTeX use.
			Like everything in this site, I write them for me. 
			Although I still hope that others find them useful.</p>

			<h2>Engines</h2>
			<p> There are few different tex engines. 
			The engines are executables that reads the .tex files and outputs printable files, such as dvi or pdf.
			Different engines use bit different syntax.
			I use pdflatex for my documents. 
			This means my notes works also with latex.
			As one can expect from the names, difference is in output files.

			</p>

			<h1>Preamble</h1>

			<h2>\documentclass[options]{class}</h2>
			<p> 
			The documentclass tag is the first tag used for the document. 
			It defines what kind of document is to be created, mainly the format.
			Normally when I start writing, I seldom use any other options than in table below. 
			</p>

			<!--Options table -->
			<table>
			<tr>
				<th colspan="2">Typical options </th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td id="wide">fontsize	</td>
				<td>default 10pt</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td id="wide">paper size	</td>
				<td>default letterpaper. Other options a4paper, a5paper, executivepaper, legalpaper</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td id="wide"> fleqn</td>
				<td>Left aligned formulas instead of centered </td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td id="wide">sides</td>
				<td> oneside, twoside. By default the book class has twosided and report and article classes onesided. 
			</tr>
			</table>

			<p> The classes define the format of the document.
			The class must always be defined in the document.
			The document type cna be changed easily, without any need to touch the text.
			</p>

			<!-- Class table -->
			<table>
			<tr>
				<th colspan="2">Typical classes</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td id="wide"> article </td>
				<td> For short articles, short reports etc. </td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td id="wide"> book </td>
				<td> For the books. </td> 
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td id="wide"> report </td>
				<td> For the reports </td>
			</tr>
			</table>

			<h2>UTF-8</h2>
			<p>
			To set LaTeX to be able use scandic fonts simply add:<br>
			</p>
			<p class="code">
			\usepackage[T1]{fontenc} <br>\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
			</p>
			
			<h1>The article </h1>
			<h2>\begin{document} ... \end{document}</h2>
			<p>
			The article goes between these tags.
			Should be written as they are in header.
			</p>

			<h2>\include{filename}</h2>
			<p>
			Not everything has to be written in one document. 
			The file names don't have to have .tex added.
			Also everything is not need to be in same folder. 
			For filename use:
			</p>
			<p class="code">path/filename</p>

			<h2><a name="reference"></a>The references</h2>
			<p> The references can easily added to document by adding before the \end{document} 
			<p class="code">
			\begin{thebibliography}
				<br>\bibitem{ref}
				<br>Reference info
			<br>\end{thebibliography}
			</p>
			When citing to source, use <p class="code"> \cite{ref} </p> in your text.
			This is usable when there is no need to collect own reference database, using bibtex.
